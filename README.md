## AceTipper

AceTipper is an application that will help you print out paper-wallets for the purposes of tipping Bitcoin Cash (BCH) to people who may or may not be familiar with Bitcoin.

This application looks to solve 2 problems that I saw.

The need for the recipient (who may not be familiar with Bitcoin) to have to install a wallet in order to get some BCH can be a barrier.

Many folks (like servers at restaurants) may take the Bitcoin Cash tip, out of politeness, but then never claim them. Therefore, you lose your funds for no benefit to anyone.

This app manages your tips, prints paper wallets of various designs, but also allows you to take back your tip if it hasn't been claimed for a period of time - say a year.

If you have feedback I would love to hear about it.
